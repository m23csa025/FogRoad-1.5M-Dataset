# FogRoad-12M : A Million-Frame Video Testbed for  Real-World Defogging

Adverse weather conditions, particularly fog, critically impair vision-based perception systems essential for autonomous driving. Progress in defogging research has been severely limited by existing datasets, which predominantly contain artificially generated scenarios, isolated images, or synthetic renderings. These datasets lack the realism, temporal continuity, and scale necessary to develop robust algorithms suitable for real-world applications. To address these limitations, we introduce \textbf{FogRoad-12M}, a comprehensive, video-centric dataset containing over 12 million high-resolution frames captured across diverse Indian road environments, including highways, urban streets, and rural paths. Systematically collected under varying illumination (daytime, dusk, nighttime) and diverse weather conditions (clear, mild fog, dense fog, rain), each sequence is annotated with precise temporal and geographic metadata. FogRoad-12M uniquely enables rigorous benchmarking of state-of-the-art defogging algorithms using widely accepted no-reference image quality metrics (e.g. BRISQUE, NIQE, FADE). Our evaluations showcase significant performance disparities that appear exclusively under authentic video-based fog conditions, highlighting critical gaps in current approaches trained predominantly on synthetic or isolated image data. By combining unprecedented realism, extensive scale, and rich temporal context, FogRoad-12M establishes a robust benchmark that significantly advances research in image and video defogging, vision-based perception in adverse conditions, and reliable autonomous navigation under realistic, dynamic visibility challenges.
